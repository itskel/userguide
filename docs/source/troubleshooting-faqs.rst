Troubleshooting & FAQs

**Is there a way to switch CounterSocial to a light background?**
	**A:** Unfortunately, no. CounterSocial does not yet support native theming but is something we hope to develop in the future. We hear mixed results, but you can try using the DarkReader Extension to your Chrome browser to lighten the background. 

	Dark Reader Browser Extension: `Chrome and Brave <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en-US>`_ or `Firefox <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/>`_ or `Firefox <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/>`_
 	Using "Light Mode," start by adjusting the settings to +45 brightness, +30 contrast, and +50% sepia and adjust to your liking.

**The Desktop version is too busy for me? Is there a way to turn off features?**
	**A:** We understand that CoSo on the desktop can be overwhelming. Go to Edit Profile > Preferences and enable Ostrich Mode to remove the MSNBC news ticker, COSOTV channel selector, COSOCOM radio scanner, Network Sentiment Meter, and Trending Hashtags. Note: We are aware that some users lose Ostrich Mode after logging out of CounterSocial. A fix is on our considerably long to-do list. You can easily re-enable it in your Preferences.

	For a one-column layout, open Counter.Social into a new tab and make that tab as "skinny" as possible. You could also give the mobile apps a try. These will let you micro-dose CounterSocial one column at a time.

**When I upload an image, it posts upside down or on its side. How do I fix this?**
	**A:** To protect your privacy, CoSo's Sanitizer removes all metadata from your images before they post. This meta data includes photo orientation. You can re-add that information by making a minor edit to the photo on your device, saving it, and reattaching it to post. You may also choose to retake the photo while holding your camera in a horizontal, landscape position. 

**What is SANITIZER**
	**A:** Sanitizer is a core CounterSocial security feature and serves two purposes. First, it strips all personally identifiable tags from posted URLs. Second, it removes all metadata from uploaded media. If you'd like to post a URL and preserve the original link tags, add the term "nosanitize" anywhere in the post text to turn off this feature. The most common use case for this is time-stamped youtube links. 


**How do I find people to follow?**
	**A:** If you're looking for a specific person, you can use Search (located below the CounterSocial logo on desktop or accessible via the magnifying glass on mobile) to search for usernames or portions of usernames. If you are seeking people interested in similar topics, use the search box to search for hashtags. Don't be alarmed if the search tells you a hashtag has no posts. Just tap it to see what's there and who is posting.

	The best way to find *your* people is to post about what you're interested in, include hashtags you love, and follow the people who like them. If you are migrating from another platform, consider creating a unique hashtag to share amongst friends to serve as a meeting place as they arrive.

**Someone is harrassing me in my DMs. How do I report it?**
	**A:** On the offending post, click the three dots in the bottom right corner and select "Report @username." A field is provided to elaborate on your report. DMs are encrypted and only visible by those included as recipients. Once a DM is reported, encryption is unlocked, allowing Jester to read the message and enforce the appropriate consequence. Please do not abuse this feature. If it is not indeed a case of abuse, please use the "Mute" or "Block" options instead.

**How do I report a Troll?**
	**A:** On the offending post, click the three dots in the bottom right corner and select "Report @username." You will have the ability to add multiple posts in your report, as well as a comment, if needed. CounterSocial has a zero-tolerance policy towards trolling and community abuse of any kind. There is no deliberation and no appeals process. Reported trolls disappear, not in days or weeks, but in minutes. Please do not abuse this feature. If it is not indeed a case of abuse, please use the "Mute" or "Block" options instead. 


**Is there a way to import or auto-follow friends from Twitter or my phone contacts?**
	**A:** No. Counter.Social is both privacy- and security-focused by design. The platform will never scan your phone contacts or data-mine your followers on other platforms. 

**Help! I've accidently unpinned the Community Firehose. How do I get it back?**
	**A:** On the Desktop app, you can always find the link in the right-side Navigation column. If it is hidden behind your most recent post view, click on the CounterSocial in the upper-left corner of the page to reset your layout. Next, click on the "Community Firehose" link in the navigation column. To re-pin it to your layout, open the settings icon at the top of the column and selet "+Pin." 

**When I try to publish my post, the post button doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?**
	**A:** There are multiple issues that cause this problem. 
#. You have exceeded the maxium character count.
#. Your post may contain special characters that resemble programming code that hackers use to exploit the system. Check for odd punctionation combitions such as brackets [], currency symbols $, and/or quotations "" and, if found, make some adjustments.
#. Lastly, CounterSocial may be experiencing intermittent issues. If the solutions above are not the issue, refresh the page to try again. 

**When I upload my image/video/gif, it doesn't attach to the post. What gives?**
	**A:**It's likely you are uploading media over the maximum allowable sizes of 8MB for images and 40MB for audio/video, or are uploading an unsupported file type. 


**I am missing columns or features from the Desktop version. Where are they?**
	**A:** CoSo is optimized to fit the device or screen resolutioin that you are using. In the case where the screen resolution is low or your on a small laptop or monitor, the layout will automatically drop non-core items to fit core elements in the space. This may include your avatar, screen name, and "edit profile" link above the post box, the CounterShare button in the Navigation column, or the News broadcast or CoSoCom players on the bottom left. To check if this the case, on your keyboard hold down the CTRL key while pressing - (minus) to zoom out or + (plus) to zoom back in. 

	This is a temporary issue while CoSo evolves to be responsive on all screens and devices.  

**I am having problems with my PRO subscription. How do I get help?**
	**A:** Access your Pro Account Portal here. Log in, and on the Home page in the lower right is a SEND EMAIL button. Fill in the form and submit it. Check your Pro Account registered email for the response.

**How does the algorithm work here?**
	**A:** It's actually very simple. There isn't one.

**How do I increase my Follower count?**
	**A:** Follower counts are meaningless on CoSo. There's no algorithm here, so there is no expectation for anyone to follow you back. Focus on whom you want to follow, not who follows you.

**Where are the GIFS?**
	**A:** For now, you've got to do .gifs old school. Head to https://tenor.com and download your favourite .gif. For best results, use the .mp4 version. Then, upload your .gif as a media attachment using the camera icon in the post editor.
