The Desktop Layout
------------

CounterSocial's (CoSo) layout presents various content in a series of columns. You can have as many or as few columns as you wish and configure each column's settings to your liking. When you first sign up, focus on your attention on the "Community Firehose" column. This is everyone's public post and a great place to get familiar with the layout while exploring features. If you have questions, simply create a post and include the #help hastag and a member of the community will guide you. 

.. tip:: Visit your preferences to enable "Ostrich Mode" for a more minimal desktop layout. This mode will remove the "extras" including the news ticker, CoSoCom emergency radio scanner, and live news station feeds. You can also adust your browser width to thin to force a one-column mobile-reponsive layout.

The Navigation + View Column
------------

When you click on any profile name, hashtag, or post, contents will automatically override the right navigation column, giving you an expanded view of the contents including threads, post replies, hashtag feeds, and full user profiles. When you are done, click the "Back" button at the top to return home to the navigation column. You can reset this column at anytime by clicking the G and S keys at the same time, or by clicking the Counter Social logo.
