.. tip:: Visit your preferences to enable "Ostrich Mode" for a more minimal desktop layout. This mode will remove the "extras" including the news ticker, CoSoCom emergency radio scanner, and live news station feeds.

The Navigation + View Column
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you click on any profile name, hashtag, or post, contents will automatically override the right navigation column, giving you an expanded view of the contents including threads, post replies, hashtag feeds, and full user profiles. When you are done, click the "Back" button at the top to return home to the navigation column. You can reset this column at anytime by clicking the G and S keys at the same time, or by clicking the Counter Social logo.
