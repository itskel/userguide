The Post Box is located in the left column on desktop version or by pretting the blue pencil icon on the bottom right corner of your mobile device. The default character limit for text posts is 500 characters and can include links, hashtags, polls, content warnings, and emojis. PRO users can adjust privacy at the post-level as well as set an expiration date for a post to expire and self-distruct. 

Links & Link Sanitizer
------------
When posting links, only the first 23 characters will appear regardless of the original legnth. The Counter.Social platform includes a link sanitizer that will automatically scrub out advertising tracking variables attached to links from 3rd party sites to protect your privacy. In the case where this impacts your link's functionality type *nosanitize* anywhere in your post to turn off this feature. The most common use case for this is time-stamped YouTube links. 

Once posted, the platform will automatically pull up the link preview content including news headlines, article card images, and/or functional media players such as YouTube, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, and Spotify. These link previews are generated the first time your link is clicked or the next time you refresh your feed.

Hashtags
------------
To make your posts more searchable and discoverable by other users, add a hashtag by prepending a keyword with the pound(#) symbol. As you type, you will see suggested hashtags already in use below the post box. Counter.Social is hashtrag-driven with many users configuring their feeds to only display the hashtags and keywords they are interested in, or by using filters to omit this content from their view.  

.. tip:: Counter.Social was originally an instance on the Mastodon network where multiple communities shared a central "Community Firehose." During this time, CoSo users would often prepend hashtags with #CoSo____ to differentiate between our community and others. While we are no longer connected to Mastodon's Federation, the hashtags are still in use and popular to this day. Examples include #CoSoMusic, #CoSoArt, #CoSoTips, #WritersofCoSo, #DogsofCoso, and others.
