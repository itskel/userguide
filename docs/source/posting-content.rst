The Post Box
------------
.. image:: img_postboxlegend.jpg

The Post Box is located in the left column on desktop version or by pretting the blue pencil icon on the bottom right corner of your mobile device. The default character limit for text posts is 500 characters and can include links, hashtags, polls, content warnings, and emojis. PRO users can adjust privacy at the post-level as well as set an expiration date for a post to expire and self-distruct. 

Links & Link Sanitizer
------------
CounterSocial doesn't track its users, but even better than that - we don't let 3rd parties track you either. All outbound links are automagically sanitized to remove any embedded tracking parameters. In the case where this impacts your link's functionality type *nosanitize* anywhere in your post to turn off this feature. The most common use case for this is time-stamped YouTube videos. 

Once posted, the platform will automatically pull up the link preview content including news headlines, article card images, and/or functional media players such as YouTube, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, and Spotify. These link previews are generated the first time your link is clicked or the next time you refresh your feed.

Hashtags
------------
To make your posts more searchable and discoverable by other users, add a hashtag by prepending a keyword with the pound(#) symbol. As you type, you will see suggested hashtags already in use below the post box. Counter.Social is hashtrag-driven with many users configuring their feeds to only display the hashtags and keywords they are interested in, or by using filters to omit this content from their view.  

.. tip:: Counter.Social was originally an instance on the Mastodon network where multiple communities shared a central "Community Firehose." During this time, CoSo users would often prepend hashtags with #CoSo to differentiate between our community and others. While we are no longer connected to Mastodon's Federation, the hashtags are still in use and popular to this day. Examples include #CoSoMusic, #CoSoArt, #CoSoTips, #WritersofCoSo, #DogsofCoso, and others. 

Attaching Media & Files
------------
Click on the camera icon to attach photos, animated GIFs, or videos to your post. On the desktop version, you can also drag-and-drop the media file to the post box to auto-upload. If you would like to share other files types, visit https://share.counter.social/ (also found in the right navigation column) to use CoSo's secure file sharing service, CounterShare. 

Media File Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Images - PNG + JPG images up to 8mb in size. Up to 4 images be uploaded at a time. The image will display a 16:9 preview with the full version displayed on click.
* Animated GIFs up to 8mb in size. GIFs render as MP4 videos and can also be uploaded 4 at a time, but not in combination with other image formats.
* Videos - MP4, M4V, MOV videos up to 40mb in size and no longer that 1 min in legnth. Video will be transcoated to H.264 MP4 files upon posting.

.. tip:: Counter.Social automatically scrubs all meta-data from your media files including the date, location, and camera settings. This includes photo orientation. If you upload an image and it is upside down or on its side, make an inconsequential edit, save it, and then reupload.  

Editing Media
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once attached, hover over the image thumbnail and click the "Change Preview" link to adjust the image preview and add a text description for the visually impared. This discription appears for users accessing Counter.Social via a screen reader or other similar technology. 

.. warning:: If your image, GIF, or video is NSWF, contains mature, adult or graphic content, or may negativelly impact those with PTSD or photosensitivity issues, please click the eye icon to mark your media as sensitive and/or add a content warning to your post. Be advised, Counter.Social is committed to providing NO SAFE HAVEN for Child Sex Abuse Material. All uploaded images are hashed and compared against NCMEC databases of known CSAM hashes at our infrastructure edge. 

Setting Your Media Preferences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Navigate to Edit Profile --> Preferences and scroll to the *Media Display* section to configure how you want media to display in your personal feeds. You can automatically hide all media marketed as "sensitive," choose if animated GIFs auto-play or even reduce their motion.

**Public** - Posts appear in the community firehose, your friend's timelines, and on your profile page. If your Public Landing Page is enabled, these posts are visible to the general public and are indexed by search engines. 

**Unlisted (PRO Feature)** - Same as Public posts, but do not appear in the community firehose. 

**Followers-Only (PRO Feature)** - Visible to only users that follow you and anyone that is mentioned in the post. These posts can not be boosted, except by yourself. 

**Direct Message (PRO Feature)** - Visible to only the user that is mentioned in the post. The receiptient will recive a notification. All DMs are encrypted and cannot be accessed by any party, including Jester, unless they are mentioned. Establishing this as a PRO feature eliminates DM spam, scams, and phishing attempts. In the case you are a regular subscriber and wish to  have a private conversation with a PRO user, you can ask them to initiate the DM from their side. 


Delete & Redraft
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rejoice! A version of the "edit" button has arrived. After you have posted, if you need to make changes to your post, click the three dots in the bottom right corner and select "Delete & Redraft" to make changes and repost. Keep in mind, all boosts and favorites will be reset and any replies will not be linked to the new version.
