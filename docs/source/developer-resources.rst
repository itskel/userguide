Policy on BOTs & Automation
----------

CounterSocial has a strict policy against bots or automation scripts designed to manipulate the platform, distribute spam, datamine, or manipulate followers. However, personal projects including creative AI experiments, media players, and 3rd party integrations are considered. If you are unsure if you project meets the guidelines, please send a DM to @th3j34t3r to pitch your idea.
